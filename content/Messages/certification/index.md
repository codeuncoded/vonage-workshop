## Messages and Dispatch APIs Certification

### Objective

You have learned how to send messages with the Messages API, but now you need to include the [Dispatch API](https://developer.nexmo.com/dispatch/overview) so that you can fail over from one channel to another!

Your job is to create an application that notifies your customer that their package will be delivered tomorrow.

Initially, you will attempt to contact them using a plain SMS message.

If that fails to elicit a response (and, for the purposes of this exercise let's assume that you'll wait 180 seconds), you should failover to either a second (but different) SMS message or a Facebook Messenger message containing an image.

You don't need to worry about inbound messages - let's just assume that your user is unresponsive.

### Delivery

Please see [here](/basic-concepts/certification/) for details of how to submit your completed project.
