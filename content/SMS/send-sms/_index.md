1. A nexmo Number,
2. Your Phone number
3. Your Nexmo Number
4. Your NEXMO_API_KEY
5. Your NEXMO_API_SECRET

```js

const nexmo = new Nexmo({
  apiKey: "NEXMO_API_KEY",
  apiSecret: "NEXMO_API_SECRET"
})
	
let text = "ðŸ‘‹Hello from Nexmo";
 
nexmo.message.sendSms("NEXMO_NUMBER", "TO_NUMBER", text, {
  type: "unicode"
}, (err, responseData) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    if (responseData.messages[0]['status'] === "0") {
      console.log("Message sent successfully.");
    } else {
      console.log(`Message failed with error: ${responseData.messages[0]['error-text']}`);
    }
