## Introduction

When your users interact with Vonage, for example by calling a Vonage number, Nexmo needs to notify your application so that it can take required action. In the case of a Voice application, this might be to play a text-to-speech message to the caller when Vonage answers the call. Vonage can also keep your application notified of various events that take place during the call, such as when the caller hangs up. These notifications from Vonage are implemented using [webhooks](/concepts/guides/webhooks).

An issue is when you are testing your application locally on your development machine, your computer is unable to receive these webhook notifications as it is not on the public Internet.

One way to work around this problem is to use a free tool called [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Ngrok creates a secure tunnel connecting the Internet to your locally-running application. Notifications from Vonage are then be routed through Ngrok to your local machine.

## Get Started

To get started with Ngrok, follow these steps:

1) Download and install Ngrok using the [instructions](https://ngrok.com/download) for your platform.

2) Start your application locally, and check which port it uses. For example, if you usually use `http://localhost:3000` to access your application, then the port is 3000.

3) Create an Ngrok tunnel to this port with a command such as `ngrok http 3000`. You will see something similar to the following:

``` shell
ngrok by @inconshreveable (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status online
Account YourUsername (Plan: Free)
Version 2.3.35
Region United States (us)
Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding http://abcdef1.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
Forwarding https://abcdef1.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000

Connections ttl opn rt1 rt5 p50 p90
```

4) This command will show the URL of the tunnel, which will look similar to `https://abcdef1.ngrok.io`. Copy this URL.

5) [Configure your webhooks](#setting-webhook-endpoints) to point to this URL.

Note that each time you start up the Ngrok tunnel, you will receive a new URL so don't forget to update the webhooks configuration accordingly!

## Ngrok plans

Paid Ngrok plans can reserve tunnel names and choose which one to use when they start up, so you can avoid having to reconfigure your webhooks. If you have a paid Ngrok account, you can start on your own domain using a command such as:

``` shell
ngrok http -subdomain=mydomain 3000
```

In this case you will something similar to the following:

``` shell
ngrok by @inconshreveable (Ctrl+C to quit)

Session Status online
Account YourUsername (Plan: Basic)
Version 2.3.35
Region United States (us)
Web Interface http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding http://mydomain.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000
Forwarding https://mydomain.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000

Connections ttl opn rt1 rt5 p50 p90
```

This has the advantage that each time you start Ngrok you won't need to reconfigure your webhooks.

## Ngrok web interface

In addition to the tunnel URL displayed in the command output, you will also see a URL for the "Web Interface" (`http://127.0.0.1:4040`). The web interface allows you to examine the details of all the requests received by the tunnel and the responses returned. This is a very useful debugging tool.

In the web interface you can also use the "Replay" button to repeat a request rather than having to send yourself lots of text messages or continuously reproduce whatever event your webhook code is responding to. These features make testing your application's response to webhooks much more convenient.
