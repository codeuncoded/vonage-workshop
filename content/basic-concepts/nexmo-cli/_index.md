The Nexmo CLI is a Node.js application, so you need to have `node.js` and `npm` installed to run it. If you don't already have these, follow the steps [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Once you have `node.js` and `npm`, you can install Nexmo CLI by performing the following steps:

First, install the CLI globally:

```
npm install nexmo-cli -g
```

Then, configure the CLI with your API key and secret:

```
nexmo setup API_KEY API_SECRET
```
