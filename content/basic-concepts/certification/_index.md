## Gaining your certification

If you are attending a live workshop, your instructor will tell you how to submit your certification.

If you are doing this course via our Learning Hub, then you will be prompted to enter either a GitHub URL or upload your zipped code files.

> Please include a `README` file that tells us how to set up and run your application.

We will review these and, if everything looks OK, award you with your certification!

If you are unable to submit your project by either of the above methods, then please email it to us at `apiglobaltraining@vonage.com`.
