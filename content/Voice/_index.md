## Voice API Overview

The Nexmo Voice API is the easiest way to build high-quality voice applications in the Cloud. With the Voice API you can:

* Build apps that scale with the web technologies you are already using
* Control the flow of inbound and outbound calls in JSON with Nexmo Call Control Objects (NCCO)
* Record and store inbound or outbound calls
* Create conference calls
* Send text-to-speech (TTS) messages in multiple languages with different genders and accents
