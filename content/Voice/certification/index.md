## Voice API Certification

### Use case

Build a Voice API call menu that presents your users with a list of options. These should include:

* Listening to an audio file of your choice
* Hearing the current time and date
* Being transferred to another number that you own with a "we are now connecting you to an agent who will be able to help you" message

Use [any supported SDK](https://developer.nexmo.com/tools) to achieve this.
