      <description>Video API Certification Objective This is a guided activity that provides you with some initial starting code and relies on you to complete it. The solution is in two parts - the server (written in Node.js using the Express framework) and the client, which uses vanilla JavaScript.
After successfully completing the activity, you will be able to create a single participant video session and see yourself in your web cam. You can spin up multiple client instances and all will connect to the same session and therefore see the same video.</description>

The same steps taken here can be easily modified to send a message across other channels, including Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.
The steps Create your project Create a node.js project for this by running npm init and accepting all the defaults:
mkdir messages-sms cd messages-sms npm init touch index.</description>

      <description>The WhatsApp and Viber channels require some configuration before they are used. However, you can use our sandbox environment if you want to play around with them.
Visit that page and follow the instructions for the channels that you are interested in to get yourself set up. If you want to use those channels in an app, however, you need to use different API endpoints!
Usually, you make Message API POST requests to:</description>

      <description>Messages and Dispatch APIs Certification Objective You have learned how to send messages with the Messages API, but now you need to include the Dispatch API so that you can fail over from one channel to another!
Your job is to create an application that notifies your customer that their package will be delivered tomorrow.
Initially, you will attempt to contact them using a plain SMS message.
If that fails to elicit a response (and, for the purposes of this exercise let&amp;rsquo;s assume that you&amp;rsquo;ll wait 180 seconds), you should failover to either a second (but different) SMS message or a Facebook Messenger message containing an image.</description>

      <description>SMS and Verify API Certification Use case You&amp;rsquo;re building a ride sharing service. You want your users to register with the service with their mobile phone number and you will use the Verify API to ensure that they own the number that they are registering with.
Once they are registered, you want your users to send SMS to each other using the SMS API, without revealing their private mobile numbers, so you will use a virtual number to mask those numbers.</description>
