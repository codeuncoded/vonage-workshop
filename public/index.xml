      <description>SMS and Verify API Certification Use case You&amp;rsquo;re building a ride sharing service. You want your users to register with the service with their mobile phone number and you will use the Verify API to ensure that they own the number that they are registering with.
Once they are registered, you want your users to send SMS to each other using the SMS API, without revealing their private mobile numbers, so you will use a virtual number to mask those numbers.</description>

      <description>Messages and Dispatch APIs Certification Objective You have learned how to send messages with the Messages API, but now you need to include the Dispatch API so that you can fail over from one channel to another!
Your job is to create an application that notifies your customer that their package will be delivered tomorrow.
Initially, you will attempt to contact them using a plain SMS message.
If that fails to elicit a response (and, for the purposes of this exercise let&amp;rsquo;s assume that you&amp;rsquo;ll wait 180 seconds), you should failover to either an MMS message (choose or create a suitable image) or a Facebook Messenger message containing an image.</description>
